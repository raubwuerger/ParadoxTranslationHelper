 action.1.andvul: "Prior to the Paan Mokar incident, the Science Academy has always summarised that a sub-temperate eco-system would lead to the evolution of careful, deliberate beings. The continued illogical behavior of the Andorian Guard belays that hypothesis. It would be prudent of you to recognise your technological inferiority."

 action.1.she: "Intelligent conversation is impossible with [From.GetSpeciesName] creatures, so under article nine hundred and thirty two, section forty eight, paragraph three, subsection 'Foreign Workforce', we will speak in your simple [From.GetSpeciesName] language. Under the corporate directives enclosed within, do not attempt to approach any Sheliak property, nor lay claim to any of the articles as stated within the directives."

We are very pleased to meet your people, and look forward to a long and profitable future of trade and commerce with you.\n\nCome [From.GetRulerName], let us make you a nice Talaxian spice stew served over lovely leola rice pilaf, to celebrate this day."
 action.1.tel: "Hmmph. I'm told this fleet is the pride and joy of the [Root.GetName], yet I find it small and unimpressive."
 action.1.terranempire: "Are you one of the vermin species that scurry in the dark, plotting how to conquer our home? Your bodies, your planets, your technology, your very souls, are ours to do with as we please. Every [Root.GetSpeciesName] will be dead or a slave for the glory of the Terran Empire. All shall feel the might of the Terran Empire."
 action.1.terraprime: "A new era is at hand... an era that exposes the concept of inter-species unity as an absolute and vicious lie. An era that will place our world before all others. Mankind casts off the shackles of alien interference and now determines its own fate.\n\nStay away from our borders alien scum. Terra Prime... forever."
 action.1.tho: "Unidentified vessel. Do not trespass in the territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly. You must leave this area immediately.\n\nWe claim this territory and are prepared to use force, if necessary, to protect our property."

Many of us are afflicted by a terrible plague known as the Phage, and would be interested to share our research with the [From.GetName]."
 action.1.vul: "Live Long and Prosper [Root.GetSpeciesName], we are the [contact_empire.GetName]. Your illogical ways are baffling and crude to us, but we will persevere in our relations.\n\nWhen other species have attempted to learn the basic tenets of Vulcan logic, it has often taken them a great deal of time, but with members of the [Root.GetSpeciesName] race I fear we may it may be simply out of your grasp."
 action.1.vuland: "Do you think we have forgotten what happened at Weytahn, pointy-ear? As far as the chancellor is concerned, we have nothing to talk about."
 action.1.vulfed: "Greetings from Earth. I represent [contact_empire.GetRulerTitle] [contact_empire.GetRulerName] of the [contact_empire.GetName]. We thank you for the assistance you have given us since First Contact all those years ago."
 action.1.vulrom: "So the ancient traitors raise their logic filled heads from the sand once again. Your failure to embrace your emotions has left you weak. Look at all we have accomplished in the great [contact_empire.GetName]."

 anomaly_failure.1.desc_STH: "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered the [Root.GetName] to dispatch a probe to investigate the moon [From.From.GetName]. Unfortunately, its braking thrusters failed, and the probe proceeded to smash into the world at full impulse."
 anomaly_failure.400.desc_STH: "For unclear reasons, the resident Science Officer decided to take out a shuttle from the [Root.GetName] to personally investigate the moon [From.From.GetName]. An explosion was detected shortly afterwards when the shuttle impacted the surface at full impulse.\n\nA review of redundant log files verified that the drone had several miscalculations due to a flaw in its cortical implant. We have initiated an update to all further implants."
 anomaly.1.desc.borg: "Although the Collective's data archives have examined it repeatedly, all calculations point towards asteroid [From.GetName] being coprolite - a piece of fossilised feces from some kind of massive life form. It appears to be almost a billion years old, and much of the fossil's original organic composition has been replaced by mineral deposits. The mineral deposits will be useful to the Collective."
 anomaly.10.a.borg: "Their biological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.10.desc.borg: "Whilst conducting a survey of [From.GetName], the drones of the [Root.GetName] picked up several life signs coming from within the asteroid. There appears to be a colony of large, burrowing worm-like lithovores within the rock, which has been riddled with tunnels. These unique imperfect life forms have somehow adapted to a life in the coldness of space."
 anomaly.15.desc.borg: "Fossils from what appears to be several species of aquatic lifeforms have been found on the barren and airless surface of [From.GetName]. There are indications that the surrounding asteroid belt was created from the remains of a shattered planet, and these findings seem to confirm that theory. Calculations via the fossils indicate this planet once supported life and was at least partially covered by water."
 anomaly.25.a.borg: "The technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.25.desc.borg: "A large portion of asteroid [From.GetName] has been hollowed out to allow for the construction of some kind of shipyard. It has been abandoned and exposed to the vacuum of space for hundreds of cycles - we have not detected anything useful onboard. The design of the shipyard itself is unique, however, and much could potentially be learned by its assimilation."
 anomaly.30.a.borg: "It will be assimilated."
 anomaly.30.desc.borg: "This asteroid was used as a junkyard by imperfect beings in the distant past. All manner of discarded machinery and metallic refuse has been deposited inside the asteroid's weak gravity well, being slowly pulled into the jumble of debris that now covers the surface. There is nothing of particular value to be found here, but a lot of the metal could be salvaged by a mining station to add to the Collective."
 anomaly.300.desc.borg: "The Collective has discovered a thriving ecosystem in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant [From.GetName]. Massive floating creatures, having evolved bodies filled with lighter than air gases, follow the wind currents and feed off the energy released by the gas giant's frequent lightning storms. These beings in turn support colonies of smaller animals that prey on atmospheric plankton and each other."
 anomaly.3030.desc.squadron: "There is a squadron of small vessels idling on the plains of [From.GetName], their sensors reacting to the [Root.GetName] in orbit around the planet.\n\nThe [Root.GetName]'s crew have been unable to confirm exactly when the ships were abandoned - for they are abandoned - or who left them there, or where they are now. According to Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], remotely activating the lightly armed ships would be trivial, should we wish to add the squadron to our fleets."
 anomaly.305.desc.borg: "A discarded cargo pod was left by someone in the upper atmosphere of [From.GetName] long ago. It has somehow escaped the notice of other spacefarers, and its decaying orbit means it would have been lost in the gas giant's crushing atmosphere within another few cycles. When the drones of the [Root.GetName] unsealed the pod, they found a stash of alien jewelry made out of precious metals, these metals could be refined to service us."
 anomaly.310.desc.borg: "A small aerostat colony was found floating just above the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. Sensor sweeps indicate it to have been self-sufficient, and remains from several different species were found on board.\n\nFurther analysis indicates the colony was some kind of social experiment conducted centuries ago that ultimately ended with the colonists massacring each other. We have assimilated all of the data found in the colony's limited databanks and added them to the Collective."
 anomaly.315.desc.borg: "A ruined network of aerostat colonies dating back at least three millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. Their original function appears to have been gas mining, but they have since been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups.\n\nThe colonies have been thoroughly stripped of anything even remotely valuable, but the mere fact that they are still aloft after all this time makes them an interesting subject of knowledge to assimilate."
 anomaly.320.desc.borg: "The strong gravity well of [From.GetName] has pulled in a massive amount of space debris which has formed a dense layer around parts of the gas giant. Most of it appears to be wreckage from a series of space battles fought in the system several millennia ago.\n\nScavengers have already scoured the debris of valuable technologies and artifacts, but a mining station should be able to recycle the metal and add it to serve the Collective."
 anomaly.325.a.borg: "Its technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.325.desc.borg: "The shattered remnants of a primitive starship can be detected in a decaying orbit deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have ventured far into the gas giant's atmosphere, perhaps in a desperate attempt to escape a pursuer, only to be crushed by the atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe vessel is too deep to be assimilated, but a structural sensor sweep of the wreckage has provided us with some interesting engineering data which we could add to the Collective."
 anomaly.330.desc.borg: "[From.GetName] frequently experiences massive and extremely violent storm systems in its atmosphere. Several dozen persistent storms are visible from orbit, with winds often reaching speeds in excess of 700 m/s. The cause of these storms is not immediately apparent, as we have found nothing in the planet's climate model that would explain them. The Collective is interested in analyzing this anomaly."
 anomaly.335.desc.borg: "The [Root.GetName] has picked up a strange energy signature coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to originate from a structure of some kind, possibly the remains of an orbital station, but the atmospheric pressure makes it impossible to approach. Nevertheless, scans of the unique signature have yielded a large amount of valuable physics data which will be added to the Collective."
 anomaly.35.a.borg: "Its technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.35.desc.borg: "A small scout craft of unknown design plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading the Collective to understand it was either piloted by remote or through some kind of primitive artificial intelligence. Although it is too damaged to be recovered in its entirety, the ship may still contain useful information to the Collective."
 anomaly.40.desc.alt.borg: "Sensor nodes have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There are large chunks of the hull missing, the jagged holes indicative of heavy weapons damage. The station is beyond repair, but salvaging it will provide the Collective with valuable materials."
 anomaly.40.desc.borg: "Sensor nodes have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There is scorching on the hull indicative of light weapons damage, and the facility appeared to be stuck in some kind of feedback loop. Our drones have managed to reprogram the base systems and the facility is now fully assimilated."
 anomaly.5.a.borg: "It will be assimilated."
 anomaly.5.desc.borg: "This asteroid appears to have been used intermittently as a base by imperfect beings one thousand cycles ago. A drone retrieval team entered the base and managed to recover abandoned material. It consisted largely of crude trinkets and artifacts, but some of it may be of value to the Collective."
 anomaly.50.desc.borg: "Asteroid [From.GetName] is pockmarked with craters from weapon blasts, and it appears to have been used as a target range by an unknown species roughly two thousand cycles ago. Residual energy readings suggest they tested increasingly exotic weaponry, including subspace bombs and some kind of singularity generator. Analysis of the unusual weapon echoes may prove useful to the Collective."
 anomaly.55.a.borg: "The minerals will service us."
 anomaly.55.desc.borg: "Upon closer examination, drones have discovered that a smaller asteroid consisting almost entirely of rare precious metals recently collided with [From.GetName]. A small, but dense, cache of metals was hidden just beneath the asteroid's surface, but now that it has been discovered, it is accessible to mining drones."
 anomaly.60.desc.borg: "This particular asteroid is an extrasolar capture, and it appears to have been washed by some kind of exotic radiation as it plummeted through interstellar space before finally settling in the [From.GetStarName] system. The original source of this radiation remains unknown to the Collective, but the [Root.GetName] has been able to pick up a wealth of physics data useful to the Collective by studying the asteroid's energy emissions."
 anomaly.6000.desc_STH: "[From.GetName] does not appear to be made up of a similar material to its parent planet, indicating that is was once a rogue planetoid which has been caught in its primary's gravity well. Further study may reveal where it originated."
 anomaly.6001.desc_STH: "[From.GetName] does not appear to be made up of a similar material to its parent planet in many places, indicating that several million years ago [From.GetName] was subjected to a significant impact event."
 anomaly.65.desc.borg: "After identifying an anomaly in the gravity well of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has discovered the shattered wreckage of an ancient ore superfreighter buried deep within the asteroid's crust. Sensor nodes detect that the cargo is on the surface and the asteroid's mineral wealth has been recategorised accordingly."

 country.50.desc.dominion: "We know that not all life is created equal. Differences in biospheres have a great deal of meaning to the solids, and understanding these differences will make us stronger.\n\nOur surveying is already in progress.

 country.53.b.borg: "This is not a priority."
 country.53.desc.borg: "Our recent assimilation of unique pre-sentient species has led analysis nodes within the Collective to indicate the presence of other nearby species of unique ability. These creatures were detected on surveyed habitable worlds, but they are difficult to capture due to their capacity to elude our sensors or local environmental constraints. It will require the full resources of a Survey Vessel for a lengthy period of time."
 country.54.desc.borg: "After an extensive search of the seabed on [From.From.GetName] using a small fleet of aquatic drones, the [Root.GetName] has finally managed to corner the target of the Collective's search - a live tarblac. \n\nThe shimmering creature, which defends itself by emitting faint psionic signals that produce a sense of dread in most organic species, was brought aboard the Science Vessel in a special water tank simulating its natural environment. Drones which have come into direct contact with the tarblac will require software patching, but the operation has been a success."
 country.55.desc.borg: "The tassargoid is an extremely lethal predator that stalks the dense jungles of [From.From.GetName] at night, paralyzing its prey with electric shocks before sucking their brains out with its tube-like mouth.\n\nThree drones from the [Root.GetName] were lost to these creatures before a specimen could be secured."
 country.56.desc.borg: "The small, rodent-like creatures known as orinthi are native to [From.From.GetName], where their habitat extends across most of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s diverse climatic regions. They breed at an extremely rapid rate, and seem to have a particular fondness for chewing on EPS cables.\n\nProcuring specimens was not a problem - in fact, after the initial creatures were collected, more of them made their way onto the [Root.GetName] by attaching themselves to our drones prior to their beaming back to the Science Vessel."
 country.57.desc.borg: "Snirans are large, burrowing creatures that live beneath the dunes of the vast equatorial deserts on [From.From.GetName]. When these predators sense movement in the sands above, they immediately raise dozens of tall spikes from their backs in the hope of impaling something edible.\n\nFinding a suitable specimen proved difficult at first, until hundreds of drones were dispatched across the desert in random directions. This led to the discovery and procurement of an unusually large specimen that had grown more than a hundred spikes on its back."
 country.58.desc.borg: "Goolanthas are large, flat herbivores that have evolved internal gas pockets, enabling them to hover a few centimeters above the ground. They move about in herds consisting of a few dozen animals, grazing on the moss and lichen that can be found on the windswept plains of [From.From.GetName].\n\nThey are ruthlessly hunted by the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s apex predators, and local analysis units estimate that only a few hundred goolantha herds remain. One of these, consisting of nine animals, has been successfully collected and will be brought back to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] for full assimilation."
 country.59.desc.borg: "Drones from the [Root.GetName] have managed to collect a small group of uddlorans from the icy surface of [From.From.GetName]. These white, furry omnivores wrap themselves into tight balls and roll across the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s snow fields at astonishing speeds - one animal was detected with a velocity of 81.4 kilometers per decacycle. This aided in their detection, since the passage of their rolling forms raised huge plumes of swirling snow."
 country.60.desc.borg: "The Zulcor are swarming insect analogues, unusual both for their large size and the fact that they are lithovores, feeding off rocks and minerals in the ground. Several drones sustained serious damage when they inadvertently passed through a large swarm, and several zulcors began to feed on their exposed cybernetic components. \n\nForce fields were required to hold these creatures prior to their transport to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] for full assimilation."
 country.61.desc.borg: "All of the specimens highlighted by the Collective's biological analysis nodes have been collected and assimilated, and their biological distinctiveness has been added to our own."
